         Java Timer

         Jakub Czecz√≥tka


A Java/Swing timer application which I wrote back in May 2007. Recently I did minor changes
to update the app to Java 7.

This application is primarily meant to help you in your tea brewing process but is in no way
limited to that.

At some point in the future I may:
 * change the concurrency model
 * add BDD tests
 * add Pause/Resume functionality
